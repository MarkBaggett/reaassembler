# reaassembler
Scapy packet fragment reassembly engines.

This module will reassemble fragmented packets using common used fragmentation reassembly techniques.  It then generates 5 pcap files.  One for each of the different reassembly engines. It also prints the payloads to the screen.

This is a rewrite of the original released in 2012 to support Python3.
